            <h2>Project details</h2>
            <p>I want to create a website where the students can view their grades and set some goals considering their grade.
		A student can give his permision to a specific course, so that they can share his personal id and grade. The 
		teachers can add grades to the students, they can add new courses or remove them. The third participant is 
		the secretary whitch gives permisions to the created users, or removes them. The website gives you the option
		,as a student, to select your target grade, and reminds you when new grades are updated to the specific 
		course, if you are able to reach your target.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>"Catalog-Live" is a website that can help students setting a reach point to a specific course. For teachers 
		it should be more easily to post the grades and having them online.</p>

            <h2>Types of design patterns used in Wireframe</h2>
		<h4><b>Global navigation</b></h4><p>We use this pattern in order to assure that no matter where you are on a page, you can access the important pages.For example, from Add-course-page, you can access Home or Courses.</p>
		<h4><b>Modal panel</b></h4><p>We use this pattern to make sure that the user cannot pass an urgent step of his action. For example, on Courses-page, the button “remove”, will popup an window, asking you if you are sure that you want to remove that course.</p>
		<h4><b>Two-panel selector</b></h4><p>We use this pattern to show info about a course without leaving the current page. For each course we show info when we press the eye button.</p>
		<h4><b>Alternative views</b></h4><p>We use this pattern to offer to the user the possibility to change the view of the web page. From each page you can decide if you want to switch to the dark mode.</p>
		<h4><b>Extras on demand</b></h4><p>we use this pattern to hide the info of each course until the user request it.</p>
