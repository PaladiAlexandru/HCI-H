            <h2>1. Project details</h2>
            <p>I want to create a website where the students can view their grades and set some goals considering their grade.
		A student can give his permision to a specific course, so that they can share his personal id and grade. The 
		teachers can add grades to the students, they can add new courses or remove them. The third participant is 
		the secretary whitch gives permisions to the created users, or removes them. The website gives you the option
		,as a student, to select your target grade, and reminds you when new grades are updated to the specific 
		course, if you are able to reach your target.</p>

            <p>"Catalog-Live" is a website that can help students setting a reach point to a specific course. For teachers 
		it should be more easily to post the grades and having them online.</p>
